this is a repo of the CSEN 401 project (The Game). 

## instructions
First each player choose either Cube or a Pyramid then for every player 2 pieces of the chosen type is placed on their initial tiles . the game starts with a 5x5 grid of tiles . the first player plays first , the players alternate turns.

Each turn has two parts (Moving and Placing) .
Moving : - First move one of your pieces to an adhacent space. the Cube can only move horizontally or vertically and the pyramid can only move diagonally. The destination tile must be unoccupied, and no more than one level higher than your starting height. If you cannot move, you lose.

Placing: -The second part of each move is to place a new tile adjacent to the man which just moved. You can place in any unoccupied square.

blocking : A square placed on level 3 (making it 4 above the base) is immediately replaced by a dome . Domes cannot be moved onto or built upon.

The normal way to win is to move one of your Pieces to stand on level 3
The other way to win is to box in your opponent so he cannot move
